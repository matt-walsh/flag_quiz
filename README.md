# Project
Final project for my first year logic course. we were tasked to create a web app that would read a local JSON file, process it to extract names of countries, and add them to a dropdown input element. 

Once a country was selected, information about that country would be displayed for the user, including an image of that countries map.

As bonus points, we were to add addition functionality in the form of a quiz on countries flags.

## Status
Country Review: *Complete*

Flag Quiz: *In Progress*
